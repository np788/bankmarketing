# bankmarketing
Hello! This was a project in Python that was created for the Python for Data Science course at New York University. The question we wanted to answer: can we predict whether bank clients will subscribe to fixed-term deposit products (for example, CDs) based on a number of categorical and numerical features? All work was obviously done in Python. Other team members were Chaitra Hedge and Aakash Kaku.

- Analyzed the prior marketing campaigns of a Portuguese Bank using various ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forests,Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost and predicted if the user will buy the Bankâ€™s term deposit or not

- Recommended, the marketing team, ways to better target customers using feature importance maps and business intuition
