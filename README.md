# bankmarketing
Hello! This was a project in Python that was created for the Python for Data Science course at New York University. The question we wanted to answer: can we predict whether bank clients will subscribe to fixed-term deposit products (for example, CDs) based on a number of categorical and numerical features? All work was obviously done in Python. Other team members were Chaitra Hedge and Aakash Kaku.

Analyzed the prior marketing campaigns of a Portuguese Bank using various ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forests,Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost and predicted if the user will buy the Bankâ€™s term deposit or not

Recommended, the marketing team, ways to better target customers using feature importance maps and business intuition

Instructions to run the code:

Make sure the data file ("bank-additional-full.csv") is in the same directory as the ipython notebook or edit the ipython notebook accordingly.
Make sure to run the notebook in python 3 environment. Make sure all the dependencies used in the notebook are installed in the local machine.
Run the code sequentially as given in the notebook.
Notebook is commented adequately to give the rational, inferences of the executed code.
