# bankmarketing
Hello! This was a project in Python that was created for the Python for Data Science course at New York University. The question we wanted to answer: can we predict whether bank clients will subscribe to fixed-term deposit products (for example, CDs) based on a number of categorical and numerical features? All work was obviously done in Python. Other team members were Chaitra Hedge and Aakash Kaku.
